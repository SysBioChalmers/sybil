# sybil - Efficient Constrained Based Modelling in R

The package `sybil` is a Systems Biology Library for R, implementing algorithms for constraint based analyses of metabolic networks (e.g. flux-balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM), robustness analysis and flux variability analysis).

### Installation

For various reasons, `sybil` is temporarily not available on CRAN anymore. Until then, use the following commands in the R console to install this package:

```R
 remotes::install_github("SysBioChalmers/sybil")
```
