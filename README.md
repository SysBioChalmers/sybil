# sybil - Efficient Constrained Based Modelling in R

The package sybil is a Systems Biology Library for R, implementing algorithms for constraint based analyses of metabolic networks (e.g. flux-balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM), robustness analysis and flux variability analysis).

### Installation

Please consider downloading and installing the package via the R internal package management:
```
install.packages("sybil")
```
Alternatively, you can visit the [CRAN package website](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sybil).
